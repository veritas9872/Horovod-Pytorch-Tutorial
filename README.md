# Horovod Tutorial for Pytorch

### Introduction

[Horovod](https://eng.uber.com/horovod) is a open-source library for distributed deep learning.

It uses the [Ring-AllReduce](http://andrew.gibiansky.com/blog/machine-learning/baidu-allreduce)
algorithm for efficient distributed training of neural networks. 

This repository is a very simple hands-on guide for using Horovod-Pytorch with NVIDIA-Docker.

The aim is to provide a template for other projects using Horovod for Pytorch.

It also attempts to provide a more detailed explanation of what is going on.

The Horovod [documentation](https://horovod.readthedocs.io/en/latest) 
leaves much to the imagination as of February, 2020.

Here, I try to explain the details as much as I can.

### Installation

To run this project please install 
[NVIDIA-Docker](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-docker) first.

NVIDIA-Docker has many dependencies, such as the NVIDIA driver and Docker.

These are all necessary for this project.

I am using Docker because I have found that local installation often fails.

This is likely due to complicated dependency issues.

Also, catastrophic errors are easier to handle in a Docker container than on a local computer.

Please view basic [Docker](https://docs.docker.com) concepts for this project.

*Don't be afraid! It's not that difficult to understand!*

### Environment

The Docker container generated by the Dockerfile will create a 
Ubuntu 18.04 LTS Container with CUDA10.0, CUDNN version 7.6.0.64-1,
NCCL version2.4.7-1, OPENMPI version 4.0.2.

Python version is 3.6.7, Pytorch is 1.4.0, and Torchvision is 0.5.0.

The settings were modified from the currently available official horovod image.

The current official image has an issue with pillow 7 incompatibility with Torchvision 0.4.2.

### Task

A very simple task using ResNet34 for CIFAR10 classification was used.

Its main purpose is to explain what is going on.
